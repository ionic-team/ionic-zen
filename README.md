# ionic-zen
Zendesk theme for Ionic

This theme comes with some extras to make developing Zendesk themes a little more developer friendly. 

To get started:
`npm i`

That will automatically install zat on most mac machines and PCs with ruby installed.

To run the development server:
`npm run dev`

This will fire up Zendesk's `zat preview template` proxy service, along with sass complitation and JS concatenation/minification.
